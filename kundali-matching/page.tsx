              Kundali Matching, also known as Horoscope Matching, is a vital aspect of Vedic astrology. It is the process of matching the birth charts of the prospective bride and groom to ensure a harmonious and prosperous married life. This sacred tradition analyzes Guna Milan (point-based compatibility system), Manglik Dosha, Nadi Dosha, and other planetary aspects.
              <br /><br />
              Matching kundalis can reveal the emotional, mental, and spiritual compatibility between the couple. It helps avoid future conflicts and ensures that the marriage is blessed with love, understanding, and shared destiny.

          <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
            Kundali Matching is a detailed and precise astrological procedure that involves analyzing two individuals' horoscopes (janam kundalis) to determine their compatibility for marriage. It plays a major role in arranged marriages in Indian culture and is based on the principles of Ashtakoota Milan and Dashakoota Milan systems.
            <br /><br />
            The Ashtakoota system assesses eight aspects including Varna (spiritual compatibility), Vashya (dominance), Tara (birth star compatibility), Yoni (sexual compatibility), Graha Maitri (mental compatibility), Gana (temperament), Bhakoot (family and love), and Nadi (health and genes). The maximum score is 36, and a match above 18 is considered acceptable.
